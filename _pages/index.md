<html><h1>The Value of a Weapon in Valorant (WIP)</h1>

<h2> This website will host the Jupyter notebook writeup for the final tutorial. The tutorial will be added by 12/20/2021 at 4:00 pm by the latest. </h2>

<p>"The Value of a Weapon in Valorant" is a personal final project for the Introduction to Data Science (CMSC320) course at the University of Maryland, College Park. This final project will be a statistical analysis writeup that seeks to provide an answer to the common question many beginner players have: “which weapon should I buy this round?” <br> 
These answers are generated from a model that takes in the map, agent, and funds, and recommends them a weapon to use, based on the round results of other players in the same situation. The APIs this project will use are VAL-CONTENT-V1 and VAL-MATCH-V1. The final product and code will be hosted on this public github page.</p>
